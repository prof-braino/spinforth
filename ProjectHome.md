Version 1.1 - fixed one outstanding bug "if else else then" bug, and changed console handling so you can write an IO device on a cog and use it as the console.
One minor change to avariable to support smoother assembler operation which will be documented in the next 60 - 90 days.

Here it is, rev 1.0 and for lack of any plan, It is under GPL. If anyone wants something else, let's talk offline.

All this has only been tested with the propeller protoboard, and teraterm pro v4.51 http://sourceforge.jp/projects/ttssh2/ as a terminal program.

I run teraterm at 115.2 kb with 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control, 1ms delay per line. Tested with prop clip, and RS232 port on Toshiba laptop.
