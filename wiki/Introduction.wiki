This forth is very useful for interactive hardware and software development. It is optimized for as many free registers as possible in the cogs.

The stacks are in the cogs, and there is stack checking.

While SpinForth is fast enough for many tasks, it is not fast enough for all.

So there is a built in assembler. The assembler has not been used for any large projects, but I have one over the next couple of months, so it will get shaken out.

The downloads sections contains all the spin and forth source.


= History =

Over the summer I was using a propeller proto board. Spin is great but did not allow the kind of interactive development I like to do on microcontrollers. In the distant past I had written Forth a few times ( the last time for the first Palm Pilot) and I decided that I wanted a forth for the propeller.

I also decided it was necessary to be able to compile and run spin code as well as forth.

Hence SpinForth came to life. I wrote it form scratch over a couple of months, and started using it. I haven't done any work on it over the last 3 month, but it is stable and useful, and can rebuild itself.
