Create a New forth image involves:
defining whatever forth words you want to change/add/delete
generating the spin code
copy the new spin code into the NewForth.spin file
compile and load the base image

The forth source is in the NewForthPart1.f, NewForthPart2.f and NewForthPart3.f files.

If you want to add or change a word:

reboot
define the word(s) you want to add or change
Load spinmaker
spinmaker

This will spew forth the spin code which replaces all the code after the 3 lines of *** in the NewForth.spin file.

If you compile the file and there are less than 40 or so longs free, delete some of the long definitions at the end of the 
file, until there are 40 longs free. Strange bug and the spin monitor will not work properly if there is insufficient free
space.

If you want to delete a word(s), just before the spinmaker word is executed redefine the word(s) you want deleted.

IE if you want to delete the word free redefine it. 
: free ;
execute spinmaker, and the spin code generated will not contain the word free.
