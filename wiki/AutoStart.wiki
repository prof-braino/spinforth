The simplest way to get a forth cog to auto start a program on reset is to write a file
that is the cog number to eeprom. When the cog is reset it will load the file. The following will write a file for cog 3 which defines pin 0 to an output and makes it blink (assuming there is an led on pin 0). Not a really useful function, but you get the idea. 

{{{
200 f_write













...3


\ ( pin -- )
: blink 
  dup pxo \ pin out
    begin 
      dup pxh \ pin hi 
      100 delay_ms
      dup pxl \ pin lo 
      100 delay_ms
    0 until drop ;

: blink_start 
  cogid 1+ connectcog \ give the console to the next cog
  0 blink ;

blink_start
