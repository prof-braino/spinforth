The simplest way to get a forth cog to auto start a program on reset is to write a file
that is the cog number to eeprom. When the cog is reset it will load the file. The following will write a file for cog 3 which defines pin 0 to an output and makes it blink (assuming there is an led on pin 0). Not a really useful function, but you get the idea. 


Note: to write the file to eeprom, copy the code to the clipboard and paste into a terminal program. The fast_load and f_write words depend on keys coming in fast and buffer them to memory until there is a pause in the input.

Now if you type really fast...
